# Rust-Specific Errors
Rust is the *lingua franca* of program development on Solana. Developing in Rust brings forth a unique set of challenges
and considerations, particularly around unsafe code and Rust-specific errors. Understanding Rust's caveats aids in developing
secure, efficient, and reliable programs.

## Unsafe Rust
Rust is celebrated for its memory safety guarantees, achieved through a strict ownership and borrowing system. However, these
guarantees can become a hinderance at times, so Rust offers the [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html) 
keyword to bypass Safety checks. `unsafe` Rust is used in four primary contexts:
- **Unsafe Functions**: functions that perform operations, which may violate Rust's safety guarantees, must be marked with the `unsafe`
keyword. For example, `unsafe fn dangerous_function() {}`
- **Unsafe Blocks**: blocks of code where unsafe operations are permitted. For example, `unsafe { // Unsafe operations }`
- **Unsafe Traits**: traits that imply certain invariants that the compiler can't verify. For example, `unsafe trait BadTrait {}`
- **Implementing Unsafe Traits**: implementations of `unsafe` traits must also be marked as `unsafe`. For example, `unsafe impl
UnsafeTrait for UnsafeType {}`

Unsafe Rust exists because static analysis is conservative. When the compiler tries to determine code upholds a certain set of guarnatees,
it's better to reject a few instances of valid code than to accept a few instances of invalid code. Although the code might run fine, if the
Rust compiler does not have enough information to be confident in whether it upholds Rust's safety guarantees, it will reject the code.
Unsafe code allows developers to bypass these checks at their own risk. Moreover, computer hardware is inherently unsafe. To do low-level
programming with Rust, developers need to be allowed to do unsafe operations.

With the `unsafe` keyword, developers can:
- **Dereference Raw Pointers**: enables direct memory access to raw pointers that can point to any memory location, which might not 
hold valid data
- **Call Unsafe Functions**: these functions may not adhere to Rust's safety guarnatees, and can lead to potentially undefined behavior
- **Access Mutable Static Variables**: global mutable state can cause data races

The best way to mitigate unsafe Rust is to minimize the use of `unsafe` blocks. If `unsafe` code is absolutely necessary, for whatever reason,
ensure that it is well-documented, regularly audited, and, if possible, is encapsulated in safe abstractions that can be provided to the rest
of the program

## Panics and Error Management
A panic occurs when a Rust program encounters an unrecoverable error and terminates execution. Panics are used for errors that are unexpected
and not meant to be caught. In the context of Solana programs, a panic can lead to unexpected behavior as the runtime expects programs to handle
errors gracefully without crashing.

When a panic occurs, Rust starts unwinding the stack and cleaning it up as it goes. This returns a stack trace, which includes detailed information
on the error involved. This could supply an attacker with information about the underlying file structure. While this doesn't apply to Solana programs
directly, the dependencies a program uses could be vulnerable to such an attack. Ensure dependencies are kept up-to-date, and use version that do not
contain known vulnerabilities.

Common panic scenarios include:
- **Division by Zero**: Rust will panic when attempting to divide by zero. Thus, always check for a zero divisor before performing division
- **Array Index Out of Bounds**: accessing an array with an index that exceeds its bounds will cause a panic. To mitigate, use methods that
return an `Option` type (like `get`) to safely access array elements
- **Unwrapping `None` Values**: calling `.unwrap()` on an `Option` that holds a `None` value will cause a panic. Always use pattern matching
or methods like `unwrap_or`, `unwrap_or_else`, or the `?` operator in functions that return a `Result`

To mitigate issues associated with panics, it's essential to avoid operations known to cause panics, validate all inputs and conditions that could give 
rise to problematic operations, and use the `Result` and `Option` types for error handling. Additionally, writting comprehensive program tests will help 
uncover and address potential panic scenarios before deployment.
